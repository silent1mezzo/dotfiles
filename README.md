-----------------------
Here's a basic dump of the different dotfiles I use in my day to day activities. 

Most of these probably won't be useful but I'll try to get around to commenting them so they're helpful to other people.

### Use ###
* Clone directory to your computer
* cp dotfiles/* ~/ (or wherever they need to go)
* OR: ln -s dotfiles/<name> ~/<name>
